      TL;DR; I needed a blog & solved it in wee bit tedious but simple way. Lately, I've been doing a lot of side projects & talks. While I tweet most of my progress and research, when I finish a project, people ask if I documented the process somewhere.

    </a>
    <p class="note-desc">
      I recently graduated from Startup Institute New York — where I was encouraged to get out and attend events and coffee chats for “networking”.
