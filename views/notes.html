      Over the weekend, I wrote a small web app called Knitlify. It was a seemingly simple app, but it tuned out to be lots of learning experience. In other words, I thought I can glue together bits and pieces of code from my old projects and be done in a few hours (LOL, no). In reality, I discovered things I didn't know and learned some of the code I've been writing was not good.

      On "tech" and "non-tech" discussion, and how it's a toxic lie.<br>"I accidentally became a programmer" I often use above sentence to describe how I end up in my day job - a web application programmer. It sounds like a joke, but it's mostly true. I never tried to be a programmer.

      It's been two years since the weekend tried to use JavaScript to knit. The combination was natural, I wanted to program my knitting machine and I was a JavaScript developer.

      Can you explain the sentence "It returns a promise" to someone? well I couldn't.<br><br>
      Even though I've written plenty of promise code, the question made me realize how little I understand about it. So here is an illustrated guide to JavaScript Promise.

      TL;DR; I needed a blog & solved it in wee bit tedious but simple way. Lately, I've been doing a lot of side projects & talks. While I tweet most of my progress and research, when I finish a project, people ask if I documented the process somewhere.

      I recently graduated from Startup Institute New York — where I was encouraged to get out and attend events and coffee chats for “networking”.
      As an INTP (MBTI personality) person. This “get out and talk to people” assignment was intimidating at first, and I needed to develop my strategy to keep my sanity…here are few things I did.
