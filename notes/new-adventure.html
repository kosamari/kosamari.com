    <h1>Start of a New Adventure</h1>
<p>It's been two years since the weekend tried to use JavaScript to knit. The combination was natural, I wanted to program my knitting machine and I was a JavaScript developer.
</p><p>
This little silly side project turned out to be a much bigger thing than I ever expected. The project scope expanded from just a file transfer program to <a href="64sts.com" title="">domain specific language</a> to <a href="https://kosamari.github.io/sweaterify/" title="">digital pattern visualizer</a> to <a href="https://twitter.com/kosamari/status/808367065967067136">production tool for T-shirts design</a>. I got to present in front of many people about the project, it got me more visibility in the community, and landed me a 1st product developer job.
</p>
<p>
<b>It has been an amazing ride for past 2 years, but I'm ready for new adventure.</b>

Now, this is the part where I'm supposed to tell you <em>"After ___ years of wonderful time at tech company ___, I'm joining another tech company to do ___. This is a great opportunity and I'm excited about the new adventure, I'll be staying in/moving to [city name], but first I'm off to [vacation/time off with family]."</em> ... if I were a basic af tech person who blogs on the TED talks of blogging (definition of the medium dot com by <a href="https://twitter.com/jennschiffer/" title="">@jennschiffer</a>).

But, you all know that I'm not that basic and extremely cynical about tech culture (otherwise, why are you reading this?).
<pre>&lt;/sarcasm&gt;</pre>

It is true that the knitting project initiated lots of opportunities for me (including <a href="https://twitter.com/kosamari/status/848934055601201153" title="">the new job I just started</a>), but it is also true that I spent last a year and a half trying to grow out of "the knitting person". In fact, I spent more time on other projects and didn't do enough knitting. What I learned doing lots of project is that...
<ol>
  <li>I like graphics programming, anything that let me draw an image on a screen, I'm happy.</li>
  <li> I like digging into history and learning about how the past (and now obsolete) technology influenced what we do now.</li>
  <li>I give zero fuck about sounding smart or being an expert. I care more about explaining things in the digestible format for everybody.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>Since I got your attention thus far, let me tell you some of my favorite projects & research I've done.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Punchcards are cool and we all should learn about the automation, computation, and communication history. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7wwuZnnM9k">Talk at Reject.js 2015</a>)</li>
  <li>Tech is f*cking dominated by English, native English speaker should help non-native English speakers with this simple tricks.(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOzAly5Rs7g">Talk at Open Source and Feelings 2015</a>)</li>
  <li>Image Processing is cool & you don't always need to write in C++... in fact, Canvas + WebWorkers works great.
    <ul>

    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>Typesetting machine - the page layout coding of the past has a deep influence on CSS & and HTML <a href="http://opbeat.com/community/posts/thats-so-metal-mechanical-words-through-the-ages-by-mariko-kosaka/" title="">(Talk at WebRebels 2016)</a></li>

<p>I'm currently working on a project with <a href="https://twitter.com/noopkat">@noopkat</a> to learn more about binary data communication technology (hint: FAX machine) you can catch us present our learnings at <a href="http://2017.jsconf.eu/speakers/mariko-kosaka-suz-hinton-can-you-read-me-creative-javascript-to-make-computer-science-fun.html">JSConf EU in May</a>!
</p>
<p>It has been fun 2 years & can not thank enough for my friends who accepted my strange ideas and supported me along the way ✨. I don't really think switching job is a new adventure, rather I hope to make the community I belong more inclusive, so that more people can do awesome and fun projects. 💯🙌💕</p>
